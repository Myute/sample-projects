<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About This Repository

This github repository contains projects that are in a ready to view and ready to run format whose purpose is to demonstrate my ability as a programmer to implement fundamental and complex solutions to problems. Each project placed in this repository is selected based on how significant the project is or how interesting I found the topic.

More specific factors are:
* Demonstrates implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures
* Shows my ability to understand and implement more abstract concepts
* Exemplifies good programming practices
* Topics that I find extremely engaging to work with :smile:

This list does not contain all of my completed projects, but rather more significant and ready to view programs. I will be continually adding more to this repository as I am able to recover more projects that were not originally on gitub as well as newly developed programs which I feel show important programming skills.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Projects

To ease navigation of this repository, changes have been made to the file structures and documentation of certain projects.

## SSH Gui
Not yet Uploaded. Tkinter Gui made for managing port security on AOS 6 and 8 network switches. Made for internal use at CSUSM.

## Compiler

A Tkinter GUI, tokenizer, and syntax analyzer built in python. This was developed the course Programming Languages at CSUSM.

## Japanese Translator

Grammar aware Japanese to English translator build in C++. This was developed for Theory of Computing at CSUSM.

## Process Scheduler

C++ Implementation of process scheduling and resource allocation using various algorithms. This program utilizes linux specific libraries for thread management.

## Receipt Reader

A Python 3.8 program which reads an image of a receipt and utilizes computer vision, text reading, and image editing packages to store specific information in a JSON format.

## Towers of Hanoi AI

An Artifcial Intelligence program built to solve an any height towers of hanoi puzzle using A* algorithm. This was programmed in C++ for Artificial Intelligence at CSUSM.
