<!-- ABOUT THIS PROJECT -->
# About This Project
This project was made for the course Programming Langauges at CSUSM and is a full tokenizer and syntax analyizer built in Python. TKinter was used to make a fully custom GUI including a line counter. Syntax uses Backus normal form (BNF). Additionally Regex is used to find target cases such as finding a defined variable vs a string.
